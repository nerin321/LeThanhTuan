# Issues:

## Filtering and Sorting Inside useMemo:

Filtering (filter) and sorting (sort) within the same useMemo hook can lead to unnecessary computations, especially when the balances array is large. Since both operations depend on balances, they will both be recalculated every time balances changes, even if only one of the operations is needed.
The getPriority function is being called multiple times during both the filtering and sorting steps, which results in redundant calculations.
Using toFixed for Formatting:

Using toFixed() directly for formatting numbers may cause issues with rounding or losing precision when working with floating-point numbers.
Mapping Data Multiple Times:

The code is calling map twice on the sortedBalances array: once to create formattedBalances and again to generate rows. This results in redundant iterations over the array, which can be inefficient.
Using index as key:

Using index as the key in a list can lead to performance issues, especially when the list changes, because React may not be able to efficiently optimize updates for list items.
Incorrect Dependencies in useMemo:

The useMemo hook depends on both balances and prices. However, if only prices changes and balances remains the same, the entire sorting and filtering logic will be recalculated, which is unnecessary.
